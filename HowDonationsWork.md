## Introduction ##

Donations to the ScalaFX project are processed through Paypal.  Funds are made to and under the control of the project leader (currently [Stephen Chin](http://steveonjava.com/)).  We are not a non-profit organization at this time, so you cannot deduct taxes on your donation.  If you are still interested in contributing, read on.

  * Hosting and advertising costs for infrastructure

## What Is In It For Me? (And My Company) ##

A good feeling that you are helping make the world a better place (or rewarding those who do).

If you are a company and you want something more tangible, please [contact me](http://steveonjava.com/contact) to become a project sponsor.  With a qualifying project sponsorship, you will get the following benefits:
  * Promotional placement on the website, documentation, and all presentations
  * Priority defect fixes
  * 24/7 Support (basically the cell phone number of one of the lead developers)
